              <strong>1943</strong> - Returning to Calcutta, Ray got a job in a British-owned advertising agency, became its art director within a few years, and also worked for a publishing house as a commercial illustrator, becoming a leading Indian typographer and book-jacket designer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1947</strong> - Ray had long been an avid filmgoer, and his deepening interest in the medium inspired his first attempts to write screenplays and his cofounding of the Calcutta Film Society.

            <li><strong>1949</strong> - Ray married Bijoya Das, his first cousin and long-time sweetheart.[14] The couple had a son, Sandip Ray, a film director.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1952</strong> - The success of Vittorio De Sica‚Äôs The Bicycle Thief (1948), with its downbeat story and its economy of means‚Äîlocation shooting with nonprofessional actors‚Äîconvinced Ray that he should attempt to film Pather Panchali.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1956</strong> - Pather Panchali was completed in 1955 and turned out to be both a commercial and a tremendous critical success, first in Bengal and then in the West following a major award at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival.

            <li>

              <strong>1961</strong> - Teen Kanya (1961; ‚ÄúThree Daughters,‚Äù English-language title Two Daughters) is a varied trilogy of short films about women that made an impact on the then Bengali culture of treating women.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Kanchenjungha (1962), Ray‚Äôs first original screenplay and first colour film, a subtle exploration of arranged marriage among wealthy, westernized Bengalis.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1964</strong> - Ray‚Äôs finest films based on a novel by Rabindranath Tagore, who was the principal creative influence on the director, Charulata (1964; The Lonely Wife), a tragic love triangle set within a wealthy, Western-influenced Bengali family in 1879, is perhaps Ray‚Äôs most accomplished film.
            </li>

            <li><strong>1969</strong> - Although humour is evident in almost all of Ray‚Äôs films, it is particularly marked in the comedy Parash Pathar (1957; The Philosopher‚Äôs Stone) and in the musical Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969; The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha), based on a story by his grandfather. </li>
            <li><strong>1973</strong> - With an exception of his moving story of the Bengal Famine of 1943‚Äì44, Ahsani Sanket (1973; Distant Thunder)‚Äîchiefly concerns Calcutta and modern Calcuttans.</li>

            <li><strong>1977</strong> - Ray considered making a film on the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea, saying that, as a filmmaker, he was more interested in the travails of the refugees and not the politics</li>
            <li><strong>1979</strong> - At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.</li>
            <li><strong>1980</strong> - After a gap in which Ray made Pikoo (1980) and then fell ill with heart disease, he returned to the subject of corruption in society.</li>
            <li><strong>1982</strong> - When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier The Alien script; Ray claimed that E.T. plagiarised his script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg's film "would not have been possible without my script of 'The Alien' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies." Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, "I was a kid in high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood." (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968).[72] Besides The Alien, two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India.<br>At the Venice Film Festival, where he had previously won a Golden Lion for Aparajito (1956), he was awarded the Golden Lion Honorary Award in 1982. That same year, he received an honorary "Hommage √† Satyajit Ray" award at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Ray is the second film personality after Charlie Chaplin to have been awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University.</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - While working on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray suffered a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life. Ghare Baire, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, was completed in 1984 with the help of Ray's son, who served as a camera operator from then-onward.</li>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> - He was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.</li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Ray recovered to an extent to direct the 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). It depicts an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, and learns of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill due to a head injury sustained while he was studying in England.</li>
            <li><strong>1987</strong> - He was awarded the Legion of Honor by the President of France.</li>
            <li><strong>1992</strong> - Ray's health deteriorated due to heart complications. He was admitted to a hospital but never recovered.<br>
              Twenty-four days before his death, Ray was presented with an Honorary Academy Award by Audrey Hepburn via video-link; he was in a gravely ill condition, but gave an acceptance speech, calling it the "best achievement of [his] movie-making career". The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ray an Honorary Award in 1992 for Lifetime Achievement.<br>He was posthumously awarded the Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Directing at the San Francisco International Film Festival; it was accepted on his behalf by actress Sharmila Tagore.<br>
                <br>Ray died on 23 April, 9 days before his 71st birthday.<br><br>
